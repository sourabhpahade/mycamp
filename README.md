# mycamp
It's a  code-along project from a udemy web-dev course by colt steele

This project gives users a platform to upload details of thier camp i.e location, price, photos etc, so the other user who are in 
search for these services can find a suitable camp for thier visit. 

It reduces physical efforts from both sides (client and service provider).

I have made this project while learnig web development , In this project I have used HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Bootstrap for frontend and Node.js, MongoDB,Express.js for Backend. I have learned about sessions,cookies,aunthemtication,authorization, and many more fundamental concepts like 
APIs, ODM, etc.
